# Real Time Bus Tracker

Description of the project: Week 9 assignment is an animation of a real time bus stop from MIT to Harvard. I developed the Trimet bus stop API to show real time bus stops in Portland, Oregon.

How to run: Click the button of “Show Bus Stops in Portland Oregon”, then the markers show real time bus locations and move to the next stop.

Roadmap of future improvement: it is better to show the stop name when mouse at the marker.
